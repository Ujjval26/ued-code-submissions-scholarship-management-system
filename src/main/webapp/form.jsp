			<p class="card-text">Scholarship form 2022 - How to apply for a
				scholarship? This is a common question that pops up when you seek a
				scholarship. Every year, thousands of scholarship forms are getting
				rejected in India for reasons that are easily avoidable yet far too
				common non-fulfillment of eligibility criteria, a discrepancy in the
				details provided, or simply failing to fill in all the required
				fields. As a result, many applicants get screened out in the very
				first stage of the selection process.</p>

			<p>Thus, a correctly filled scholarship form is a primary
				requirement for an aspirant to stand any chance of winning a
				scholarship. Therefore, it is important for all the students to know
				how to apply for a scholarship before starting the application. This
				article will provide you with a brief about the key things that you
				should consider while understanding a scholarship form. Also, you
				will get the complete picture of what a scholarship form contains
				and an understanding of how can you apply for scholarships online
				through specific portals like National Scholarship Portal (NSP), UP
				Government's Scholarship and Fee Reimbursement Online System, OASIS
				scholarship portal, SJE scholarship portal and more.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Scholarship Form - Key things to consider</h3>
			<p>Both online and offline scholarship applications require a
				variety of conditions to be fulfilled. Though the application
				procedure may differ from scholarship to scholarship, here are a few
				basic steps that you should adopt while filling up the scholarship
				form:</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Get to know about the scholarship</h3>
			<p>Prior to filling any scholarship form, you should know every
				bit of information available about it. Go through the respective
				scholarship website carefully and make a list of necessary documents
				and information you require to apply.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Go through the application guidelines (if provided)</h3>
			<p>At times, some scholarship providers offer complete
				application guidelines for students to ease out the process of
				application for them. Carefully going through these guidelines
				before applying will tremendously reduce the chances of errors
				occurring in your application.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Prepare all your accomplishments</h3>
			<p>Most scholarships require supporting documents in a prescribed
				format as proof for all academic and personal information stated in
				your application and the important information that is necessarily
				required to apply for the scholarship. These may include, but aren't
				limited to, the following:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Mark sheets and certificates of educational qualification</li>
				<li>Identity proof</li>
				<li>Family income certificate</li>
				<li>Caste certificate</li>
				<li>Admission letter</li>
				<li>Essay submission</li>
				<li>Letter of recommendations</li>
				<li>Applicant's photograph</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				<b>Note:</b> Keeping a scanned copy of all the important documents
				as per the specified size guidelines is advisable to avoid
				rejections, in the case of online applications. For offline
				applications, you need to have photocopies of the required
				documents. <br> <br>
			<h3>Keep an eye on the deadline</h3>
			<p>All scholarship applications come with a deadline. To avoid
				any last-minute rush and other hurdles, you are suggested to fill
				your scholarship form as early as possible. However, in any
				circumstance, if you are unable to do that, make sure you give
				yourself enough buffer to not miss the deadline.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Start filling the form</h3>
			<p>Once you've all the information and documents on hand, you can
				begin the application procedure. We recommend you to be very
				vigilant while filling up the details, as any discrepancy may lead
				your form to be rejected. If filling an offline application form,
				you need to make sure that you avoid any overwriting in it.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Do proof read before submission</h3>
			<p>Are you done with all the mandatory details required in the
				application form? If yes, then do a thorough proof-check of the
				scholarship form once again before final submission. There's always
				a chance of human error; a thorough proof read can rectify these
				errors, though, before being submitted. Following these steps and
				paying attention to all details can ensure that you cross this first
				hurdle successfully, with a chance to win your dream scholarship.</p>

			<br> <br>
			<h3>Scholarship Form - Knowing its Details</h3>
			<p>What does a scholarship form contain? What is the important
				information required to apply for scholarships online? Whether you
				are applying for a scholarship online or offline, a standard
				scholarship form consists of the following key details-</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Personal details</h3>
			<p>This section covers your personal information such as your
				name, parents name, email id, contact details, etc. Also, there are
				some government scholarships that ask for your bank account details
				in this section such as the name of the bank, account number, IFSC
				code, etc., as they disburse the scholarship amount directly into
				the account of the students.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Educational qualification</h3>
			<p>Depending on scholarship to scholarship, the academic
				requirements may vary. In this section, the students need to provide
				their current as well as previous academic details (as required).
				You may need to keep the mark sheets and academic transcripts intact
				before applying for the scholarship. It is important that you enter
				the correct information. The details that you need to provide
				include the marks, year of passing, board/university of passing your
				class 10, 12, graduation or post-graduation (As specified in the
				scholarship).</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Family income details</h3>
			<p>This section is not necessarily asked in all the scholarships.
				However, the scholarships which are being disbursed based on the
				financial need of the students may require you to enter the details
				of family income. This section requires you to provide the total
				annual income of your family (including the income of both the
				parents (if available) or guardian. Also, you need to support your
				family income with an income certificate issued by a competent
				authority.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Upload documents</h3>
			<p>While proceeding ahead in the scholarship form, you will also
				have to upload all supporting documents required. Just like all
				other details, this may also vary from scholarship to scholarship.
				Thus, prepare scanned copies of all your important documents in
				advance so as to avoid any hassle while applying.</p>

			<br> <br>
			<h3>Scholarship Form - Apply for scholarships online</h3>
			<p>With the advent of technology, most of the scholarship
				providers invite students to apply for scholarships online. While
				the step-by-step application process may vary, the basic online
				application process requires scholarship registration, student
				login, updating the details, documents upload and final submission.</p>

			<br> <br>
			<h3>Scholarship Form - Applying through National Scholarship
				Portal</h3>

				government scholarships. Introduced by the government of India, the
